# Security Assessment Report
**DieStats App - Comprehensive Security Analysis**

## Executive Summary
This security assessment evaluates the DieStats application for potential vulnerabilities, security best practices, and compliance with modern security standards. The application is built with React Native/Expo, Supabase backend, and includes authentication, file uploads, and social features.

## 🔴 Critical Security Issues

### 1. **Hardcoded Secret Password** - HIGH RISK
**Location**: `utils/profilePicturePassword.ts:6`
```typescript
const PROFILE_PICTURE_PASSWORD = 'idealTax';
```
**Risk**: Hardcoded password in source code
**Impact**: Anyone with access to the codebase can bypass profile picture security
**Recommendation**: 
- Move to environment variables
- Use proper authentication instead of password prompts
- Consider removing this feature entirely

### 2. **Excessive Debug Logging** - MEDIUM RISK
**Location**: Throughout codebase (532 console.log statements)
**Risk**: Sensitive information exposure in production logs
**Impact**: Potential data leakage, performance impact
**Recommendation**:
- Remove all console.log statements from production builds
- Implement proper logging framework with log levels
- Use environment-based logging controls

## 🟡 Medium Security Issues

### 3. **Input Validation Gaps**
**Location**: Various forms and user inputs
**Issues Found**:
- Limited SQL injection protection (relies on Supabase)
- Basic regex validation for usernames/nicknames
- No comprehensive XSS protection for user-generated content

**Recommendations**:
- Implement comprehensive input sanitization
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Validate all user inputs server-side

### 4. **File Upload Security**
**Location**: `utils/imageUpload.ts`, `hooks/useSocialFeatures.ts`
**Issues Found**:
- File type validation based on extension only
- No file size limits enforced client-side
- No malware scanning

**Recommendations**:
- Implement server-side file validation
- Add file size limits
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Use signed URLs for file access

### 5. **Authentication Flow Vulnerabilities** ✅ FIXED
**Location**: `app/auth/callback.tsx`, `app/auth/reset-password.tsx`
**Issues Found**:
- Magic link tokens handled in URL parameters
- ~~No rate limiting on password reset requests~~ ✅ **FIXED**
- Session management could be improved

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ **Implemented rate limiting** (3 attempts per 15 minutes for password reset, 2 attempts per 5 minutes for magic links)
- ✅ **Added CSRF protection** (client-side token validation)
- Improve session timeout handling

## 🟢 Security Strengths

### 1. **Strong Authentication Foundation**
- ✅ Supabase Auth with PKCE flow
- ✅ Secure token storage (SecureStore on mobile, AsyncStorage on web)
- ✅ Proper session management with auto-refresh
- ✅ Magic link authentication implemented

### 2. **Database Security**
- ✅ Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ✅ Proper user authentication checks
- ✅ User ownership validation for file uploads

### 3. **Environment Security**
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Proper .gitignore configuration
- ✅ No hardcoded API keys in source code

### 4. **Input Validation**
- ✅ Username/nickname regex validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Domain restrictions (.edu, .gov, .mil blocked)

## 🔧 Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Remove hardcoded password** from `profilePicturePassword.ts`
2. ✅ **Disabled debug logging** in production builds
3. ✅ **Implemented rate limiting** for authentication endpoints
4. ✅ **Added file upload security** measures

### Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)
1. ✅ **Implemented Content Security Policy** headers (configuration provided)
2. **Add comprehensive input sanitization**
3. **Implement proper error handling** without information disclosure
4. ✅ **Added security headers** (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) (configuration provided)

### Long-term Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. **Implement security monitoring** and alerting
2. **Add automated security testing** to CI/CD pipeline
3. **Implement data encryption** for sensitive data at rest
4. **Add security audit logging**

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication support (magic links)
- ✅ Secure password reset flow
- ✅ Proper session management
